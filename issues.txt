It pains me to do this because you did a lot of other great things in this project, but the path didn't work on my computer, so no data was loaded. I'm guessing because you're on windows?

Look into using os.paths to make sure that its portable between OSes.

Also - make sure to double check your requirements! I couldn't start the app initially because you didn't include colorama in your requirements file.

    - Colorama - On my windows system, I did not have to install colorama, it was present when I created the .venv out of the box running python 3.7.2
I have now included colorama in the requirements.txt file.

    - Path issues - The application was made on a windows PC, and I did not account for cross platform compatibility.
    Issue is now fixed and the path should be created also on none windows environments, I can't test this as I don't have a Mac or Linux box.


*******************************
Add existing data to database
The data from the inventory.csv file did not add all products and/or added products with incorrect values.

product_quantity as an Integer
product_price as an Integer
date_updated as a date

Only giving you a needs work because you didn't get an exceeds here. At least, on my computer it wasn't overwriting.

This isn't working for me either, could also have to do with the paths.
