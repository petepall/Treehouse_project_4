It pains me to do this because you did a lot of other great things in this project, but the path didn't work on my computer, so no data was loaded. I'm guessing because you're on windows?

Look into using os.paths to make sure that its portable between OSes.

Also - make sure to double check your requirements! I couldn't start the app initially because you didn't include colorama in your requirements file.

Comments: 
    - Colorama - On my windows system, I did not have to install colorama, it was present when I created the .venv out of the box running python 3.7.2
I have now included colorama in the requirements.txt file.

    - Path issues - The application was made on a windows PC, and I did not account for cross platform compatibility.
    Issue is now fixed and the path should be created also on none windows environments, I can't test this as I don't have a Mac or Linux box.

Add existing data to database
The data from the inventory.csv file did not add all products and/or added products with incorrect values.

product_quantity as an Integer
product_price as an Integer
date_updated as a date

Only giving you a needs work because you didn't get an exceeds here. At least, on my computer it wasn't overwriting.

    - Overwriting - On my system, it is overwritting the data when I import from the CSV if the date if higher than the date of the record in the database.
    In the standard import file, there is for example twice Juice - V8 Spash mentioned. One with price $1.25 and date 1/10/2018 and one with price $1.15 with date 1/13/2018.
    After the database is created and the import has ran, the record in the table is the one with date 1/13/2018. I also appended a new record in the CSV file and this was also correctly imported
    into the table.

    According the requirements document it states:
        "When entering this product into the database, if a duplicate product name is found, 
        the app will check to see which product entry was most recently updated and only save that data."

    I'm based on this checking if the date on the new record is higher than the date of the record in the DB.
    If this is the case I'm overwritting the data. If the date is equal or older than the date in the DB, I skip the record.

    I have updated this logic so that the record will be updated if the date of the new record is newer or equal to the existing record.

This is the same as before, an existing product isn't getting updated for me.

    - Overwriting an existing product - see comments above.

Menu option: b
Entering b at the menu prompt did not perform one or more of the correct actions:

A CSV file named backup.csv was generated and stored in the project folder.
The CSV contents were not correct.

This isn't working for me either, could also have to do with the paths.
